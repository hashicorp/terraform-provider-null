# null_resource

The `null_resource` resource implements the standard resource lifecycle but takes no further action. On Terraform 1.4 and later, use the [terraform_data resource type](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/terraform-data) instead.

The `triggers` argument allows specifying an arbitrary set of values that, when changed, will cause the resource to be replaced.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "aws_instance" "cluster" {
  count         = 3
  ami           = "ami-0dcc1e21636832c5d"
  instance_type = "m5.large"

  # ...
}

# The primary use-case for the null resource is as a do-nothing container
# for arbitrary actions taken by a provisioner.
#
# In this example, three EC2 instances are created and then a
# null_resource instance is used to gather data about all three
# and execute a single action that affects them all. Due to the triggers
# map, the null_resource will be replaced each time the instance ids
# change, and thus the remote-exec provisioner will be re-run.
resource "null_resource" "cluster" {
  # Changes to any instance of the cluster requires re-provisioning
  triggers = {
    cluster_instance_ids = join(",", aws_instance.cluster[*].id)
  }

  # Bootstrap script can run on any instance of the cluster
  # So we just choose the first in this case
  connection {
    host = element(aws_instance.cluster[*].public_ip, 0)
  }

  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    # Bootstrap script called with private_ip of each node in the cluster
    inline = [
      "bootstrap-cluster.sh ${join(" ",
      aws_instance.cluster[*].private_ip)}",
    ]
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `triggers` (Map of String) A map of arbitrary strings that, when changed, will force the null resource to be replaced, re-running any associated provisioners.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) This is set to a random value at create time.
